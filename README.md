# 510-lab6
This lab explores and applies advanced prompting techniques to enhance or create applications using large language models (LLMs). I explore different strategies with the Gemini, identify challenges from past LLM applications, and implement solutions using these techniques.

## How to run

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run app.py
```

## Lessons learn
- learned how tailored prompts can solve specific issues encountered in previous applications
- understanding underscores the potential of effective prompting to optimize app performance, address challenges more efficiently, and improve overall application responsiveness and user interaction.

## Questions
